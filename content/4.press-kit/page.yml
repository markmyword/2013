    ### Press Kit

    Mark My Word is India’s first Content & Design Conference. It is not just the beauty of content and design itself that we celebrate, but the people behind them.  From oil paintings to film posters, hard-core journalism to chick, poetry to product design- we invite Content and Design in any form.

    If you like what we do, please spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, you blog or any other channel. We appreciate your efforts.
